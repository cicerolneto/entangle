    If you don't have any cameras connected then there isn't
    really much you can do with the application. If you see
    this then you really ought to plug in the USB cable and
    turn on camera.

  </p>
  <p>
    Once you've plugged in a camera or two you'll want to decide
    which to use. Not all cameras support USB triggered image
    capture. This Nikon dSLR does, but the Canon point-and-shoot
    isn't much use.

    Recent Linux desktops may well have a plugin which automatically
    mounts any camera as a filesystem on the desktop. Unfortunately
    this prevents use from using the camera. If this happens you'll
    see a dialog like this one. The solution is simple, unmount the
    camera and retry. In the future we'll offer todo this automatically

  </p>
  <p>
    Once connected to a camera, the real fun can begin. The main
    camera manager window is where you can control shooting and
    settings. The 'Preview' button uses 'live view' to take a
    quick snapshot. The 'Capture' button triggers the camera
    shutter once and then downloads the result. An alternative
    approach is to trigger the shutter on the camera directly
    and have the images downloaded on the fly. This is what the
    'Monitor' button is for.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the left hand side of the screen there are 100's of controls
    for changing camera settings. In the future this control set
    will be customizable to allow infrequently used settings to be
    hidden, and important ones prioritized. The thumbnails along the
    bottom show images captured so far.

  <p>
    Some operations done on the camera can take a while to complete.
    If this is likely to happen, the progress window will appear
    allowing the operation to be cancelled if you get bored.

    The gphoto library provides a short overview of all the
    capabilities supported by the connected camrra. This dialog
    is displaying that information
