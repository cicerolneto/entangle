    The main camera manager window is where you can control shooting
    and settings. Along the toolbar are buttons to start a new shooting
    session, open an existing sessions, show/hide the settings panel,
    shoot a photo, control the display zoom level and go fullscreen.
    On the left hand side of the screen there are 100's of controls
    for changing camera settings. In the future this control set
    will be customizable to allow infrequently used settings to be
    hidden, and important ones prioritized. The thumbnails along the
    bottom show images captured so far. The diagonal stripe across
    the image is just to illustrate colour management in effect. In
    real usage this won't be there.

  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't have any cameras connected then there isn't
    really much you can do with the application. The main
    camera manager window UI will be in a disabled state,
    this dialog is displayed allowing a camera to be selected.
    If you see this then you really ought to plug in the USB
    cable and turn on camera.

    When starting the application it will automatically connect
    to a camera if only one is present. If there are multiple
    cameras available, it will display a choice rather than trying
    to pick on your behalf. This display is also available from the
    File menu, should it be neccessary to switch to another camera
    on the fly. Not all cameras support USB triggered image
    capture. This Nikon dSLR does, but the Canon point-and-shoot
    isn't much use.

  <p>
    Recent Linux GNOME desktops have a plugin which automatically
    mounts any camera as a filesystem on the desktop. Unfortunately
    that prevents this application from using the camera. If this
    happens you'll see a dialog like this one. The solution is simple,
    unmount the camera filesystem and retry. In the future we'll offer
    todo this automatically

    Some cameras may take a while to initialize with gPhoto, particularly
    if there are a lot of images on the memory card. For any operation
    take is likely to take a long time, a progress bar will be displayed
    along with a button to allow cancellation. Note that cancellation
    may not be honoured immediately though.

    Sometimes when shooting it is useful to have a larger view of previous
    shots visible for direct comparison. The thumbnails are a little too
    small for this purpose. By dragging a thumbnail out of the main window
    it turns into a tearoff "polaroid". This can be resized &amp; moved
    at will to allow large side-by-side comparisons of many images. A large
    monitor helps tremendously here.

    <a title="Camera basic folder preferences" class="fb" rel="fb" href="screenshot-prefs-folders.png"><img src="screenshot-prefs-folders.png" alt="Camera Folder Preferences"></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic folder preferences control what directory is used for
    storing sessions. Each session gets a folder, and images shot
    during that session are saved into the folder using an auto
    incrementing filename.

  </p>
  <p>
    Colour management is of course crucial when shooting and viewing
    images. The default application settings will enable colour
    management if the monitor profile is auto-detected. These preferences
    allow the profiles for the working colourspace and monitor to
    be overriden.

    The gphoto library provides a short overview of all the
