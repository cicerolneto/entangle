       Entangle: Tethered Camera Control & Capture
       ===========================================

Entangle is an application which uses GTK and libgphoto2 to provide a
graphical interface for tethered photography with digital cameras.

It includes control over camera shooting and configuration settings
and 'hands off' shooting directly from the controlling computer.

Installation
------------

The libvirt-sandbox package uses GNU autotools, so the build install
process follows the standard process documented in the INSTALL file.
As a quick start you can do

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
        --localstatedir=/var --libdir=/usr/lib
  make
  sudo make install

Or to install into a private user specific location

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/libvirt-sandbox
  make
  make install

NB, if not installing in /usr, you need to set the XDG_DATA_DIRS env
variable to point to the data directory, eg in the above example use:

  XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share:/usr/local/share:$HOME/libvirt-sandbox/share
  export XDG_DATA_DIRS
